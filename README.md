## Hi I'm Daniel Rhee
I am currently a student at the University of
California, Santa Cruz pursuing a BS in Computer Science and intend to
graduate in Spring 2027. 

I intend to pursue research and go to graduate school. I currently
am interested primarily in robotics/autonomous systems specifically in
computer vision, mapping, and control systems. I am also interested in
bioinformatics and computational mathematics. 

I currently am the autonomous racing lead at Formula Slug and am an
undergraduate research assistant working on robustifying autonomous
vehicles in the AIEA lab. You can earn more about my experience and me at
